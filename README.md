Please at first make sure you have already installed all the libraries or packages we used in our custom libraries and gui.py.
Download this repository. Open git bash and type:
      git clone https://github.com/Serob-Hayrapetyan/gui_axepsilon.git
Then open the created folder where you'll find python file named gui.py and the custom libraries which the application called while running.
Please, while running the gui.py always keep all the files together to avoid any problems. Now you can run gui.py file using command 
      python gui.py 
with terminal on Linux or with Command prompt in windows.
